# Hand-and-Face-Tracker-using-python
Real-time hand and face tracking using Python with MediaPipe. Lightweight, efficient, and customizable for applications like gesture recognition and HCI.

# Features
1.Real-Time Performance: Processes live video feed for detecting and tracking hand and face landmarks with minimal latency.
2.High Accuracy: Powered by MediaPipe's pre-trained models for precise and reliable landmark detection.
3.Lightweight and Efficient: Designed to work on systems without requiring specialized hardware.
4.Customizable: Easy to adapt for specific use cases like gesture recognition or virtual reality interfaces.

# Installation
1. Clone the Repository:
            git clone https://github.com/aryanhiremath/Hand-and-Face-Tracker-using-python.git
            cd Hand-and-Face-Tracker-using-python

2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended):
              For windows :-
                       python -m venv venv
                       venv\Scripts\activate
               For macOs/linux :-
                       python3 -m venv venv
                       source venv/bin/activate
3. Install dependencies :-
                       pip install -r requirements.txt


# Usage 
1. Run the Tracker:
               python main.py
This will open a window with your webcam feed where hand and face landmarks will be tracked in real time.
2. Adjust Parameters: You can customize settings like detection confidence or frame resolution in the main.py file.
